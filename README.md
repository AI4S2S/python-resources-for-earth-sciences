## Geospatial
### Libraries
- [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/index.html): GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

- [pySal](https://pysal.org/): A python spatial analysis library for open source and crossed platform Geospatial Data Science 

- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS` (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS` libraries.

- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Rasterio is a `GDAL` and Numpy-based Python library designed to make your work with geospatial raster data more productive, more fun â€” more Zen. It is a highly useful module for raster processing which you can use for reading and writing several different raster formats in Python. Python automatically registers all known `GDAL` drivers for reading supported formats when importing the module.
