## Geospatial
### Libraries
- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/index.html): GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

- [PySal](https://pysal.org/): A python spatial analysis library for open source and crossed platform Geospatial Data Science 

- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS` (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS` libraries.

- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Rasterio is a `GDAL` and Numpy-based Python library designed to make your work with geospatial raster data more productive, more fun â€” more Zen. It is a highly useful module for raster processing which you can use for reading and writing several different raster formats in Python. Python automatically registers all known `GDAL` drivers for reading supported formats when importing the module.

- [Georasters](https://pypi.org/project/georasters/): The GeoRasters package is a python module that provides a fast and flexible tool to work with GIS raster files. It provides the GeoRaster class, which makes working with rasters quite transparent and easy

- [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona): It reads and writes geographic data files and thereby helps Python programmers integrate geographic information systems with other computer systems.

- [geemap](https://geemap.org/): A Python package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, `ipyleaflet`, and `ipywidgets`.
