This repository contains information about python libraries broadly relevant to Earth Science. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. 

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this repository, submit an issue , or make some changes and submit a pull request . If you can’t contribute on GitHub, [send Javed Ali an email](mailto:javedali28@gmail.com). If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.

## Geospatial

- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/index.html): GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

- [PySal](https://pysal.org/): A python spatial analysis library for open source and crossed platform Geospatial Data Science 

- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS` (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS` libraries.

- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Rasterio is a `GDAL` and Numpy-based Python library designed to make your work with geospatial raster data more productive, more fun — more Zen. It is a highly useful module for raster processing which you can use for reading and writing several different raster formats in Python. Python automatically registers all known `GDAL` drivers for reading supported formats when importing the module.

- [Georasters](https://pypi.org/project/georasters/): The GeoRasters package is a python module that provides a fast and flexible tool to work with GIS raster files. It provides the GeoRaster class, which makes working with rasters quite transparent and easy

- [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona): It reads and writes geographic data files and thereby helps Python programmers integrate geographic information systems with other computer systems.

- [geemap](https://geemap.org/): A Python package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, `ipyleaflet`, and `ipywidgets`.

- [geonotebook](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook): Jupyter notebook extension for geospatial visualization and analysis developed by NASA

- [Verde](https://github.com/fatiando/verde): It is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics surveys, etc) and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., gridding).


## Hydrology
- [CMF](https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf): Catchment Modelling Framework, a hydrologic modelling toolbox.

- [TopoFlow](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow): Spatial hydrologic model (D8-based, fully BMI-compliant).

- [VIC](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC): The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) Macroscale Hydrologic Model. 

- [Xanthos](https://github.com/JGCRI/xanthos): Xanthos is an open-source hydrologic model, written in Python, designed to quantify and analyze global water availability.

- [WRF-Hydro](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_py): wrfhydrpy is a Python API for the WRF-Hydro modelling system. 

- [EXP-HYDRO](https://github.com/sopanpatil/exp-hydro): EXP-HYDRO is a catchment scale hydrological model that operates at a daily time-step.  It takes as inputs the daily values of precipitation, air temperature, and potential evapotranspiration, and simulates daily streamflow at the catchment outlet. 

- [RRMPG](https://github.com/kratzert/RRMPG): Rainfall-Runoff modelling playground. 

- [LHMP](https://github.com/hydrogo/LHMP): Lumped Hydrological Models Playground. 

- [SMARTPy](https://github.com/ThibHlln/smartpy): Python implementation of the rainfall-runoff model SMART 

- [PyStream](https://github.com/martibosch/pystream): Python implementation of the STREAM hydrological rainfall-runoff model. 

- [HydrPy](https://github.com/hydpy-dev/hydpy): A framework for the development and application of hydrological models based on Python. 

- [Catchmod](https://pypi.org/project/pycatchmod/): CATCHMOD is widely used rainfall runoff model in the United Kingdom. It was introduced by Wilby (1994).

- [wflow](https://github.com/openstreams/wflow): wflow consists of a set of Python programs that can be run on the command line and perform hydrological simulations. The models are based on the PCRaster Python framework 

- [PyTOPKAPI](https://github.com/sahg/PyTOPKAPI): PyTOPKAPI is a BSD licensed Python library implementing the TOPKAPI Hydrological model (Liu and Todini, 2002).

- [mhmpy](https://github.com/MuellerSeb/mhmpy): A Python-API for the mesoscale Hydrological Model.

- [SuperflexPy](https://github.com/dalmo1991/superflexPy): A new open source framework for building conceptual hydrological models 

- [NeuralHydrology](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology): Python library to train neural networks with a strong focus on hydrological applications


## Seismology
- [Madagascar](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Installation): Multi-dimensional data processing suite

- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki): Framework for reading, writing and processing seismic and seismological data

- [Bruges](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges/tree/master/bruges): Various geophysical equations and tools

- [Segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio): Fast library for seismic SEGY files

- [Pyrocko](https://github.com/pyrocko/pyrocko): Seismology toolkit

- [rsudp](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp): Continuous ObsPy-based visual display, sudden motion monitoring, and historical replay of Raspberry Shake data

- [SeismicZFP](https://github.com/equinor/seismic-zfp): Convert SEG-Y/ZGY files to compressed [SGZ files](https://github.com/equinor/seismic-zfp/blob/master/docs/file-specification.md) & retrieve arbitrary sub-volumes from these, fast
