This repository contains information about python libraries broadly relevant to Earth Science. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. 

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this repository, submit an issue , or make some changes and submit a pull request . If you can’t contribute on GitHub, [send Javed Ali an email](mailto:javedali28@gmail.com). If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.

## Geospatial

- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/index.html): GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

- [PySal](https://pysal.org/): A python spatial analysis library for open source and crossed platform Geospatial Data Science 

- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS` (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS` libraries.

- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Rasterio is a `GDAL` and Numpy-based Python library designed to make your work with geospatial raster data more productive, more fun — more Zen. It is a highly useful module for raster processing which you can use for reading and writing several different raster formats in Python. Python automatically registers all known `GDAL` drivers for reading supported formats when importing the module.

- [Georasters](https://pypi.org/project/georasters/): The GeoRasters package is a python module that provides a fast and flexible tool to work with GIS raster files. It provides the GeoRaster class, which makes working with rasters quite transparent and easy

- [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona): It reads and writes geographic data files and thereby helps Python programmers integrate geographic information systems with other computer systems.

- [geemap](https://geemap.org/): A Python package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, `ipyleaflet`, and `ipywidgets`.

- [geonotebook](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook): Jupyter notebook extension for geospatial visualization and analysis developed by NASA

- [Verde](https://github.com/fatiando/verde): It is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics surveys, etc) and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., gridding).


## Hydrology
-


## Seismology
- [Madagascar](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Installation): Multi-dimensional data processing suite
- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki): Framework for reading, writing and processing seismic and seismological data
- [Bruges](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges/tree/master/bruges): Various geophysical equations and tools
- [Segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio): Fast library for seismic SEGY files
- [Pyrocko](https://github.com/pyrocko/pyrocko): Seismology toolkit
- [rsudp](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp): Continuous ObsPy-based visual display, sudden motion monitoring, and historical replay of Raspberry Shake data
- [SeismicZFP](https://github.com/equinor/seismic-zfp): Convert SEG-Y/ZGY files to compressed [SGZ files](https://github.com/equinor/seismic-zfp/blob/master/docs/file-specification.md) & retrieve arbitrary sub-volumes from these, fast
